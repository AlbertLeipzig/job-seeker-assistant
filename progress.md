TO IMPROVE

- Table => colspan
- Gallery => better layout
- Hero => it should be possible to "possition" text everywhere || it should be possible to have a complete covered backgroundImage of just a part || height should be calculated by deducing the header and / or footer
- Carousel => buttons and layout
- Button => re-make it (too many side effects)
- basicInteraction mixin does not work properly
- Modal and Notification or only one component?
